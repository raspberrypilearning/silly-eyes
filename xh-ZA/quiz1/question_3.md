<span style="color: #0faeb0">**User interaction**</span> is how the project reacts to the user. The 'Silly eyes' project that you have made probably has lots of <span style="color: #0faeb0">**user interaction**</span>!

Which of these scripts allows user interaction after the program has started?

--- choices ---

- ( )
```blocks3
when [timer v] > (10)
clear graphic effects
```

  --- feedback ---

The graphic effects are cleared after the timer reaches 10. The user does not have to do anything, so there is no user interaction.

```blocks3
when backdrop switches to [forest v]
say [hello] for (2) seconds
```

  --- feedback ---

The sprite says "hello" after the backdrop switches. The user does not have to do anything, so there is no user interaction.

- (x)
```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
change [color v] effect by (25)
```

  --- feedback ---

The user has to click on the sprite to change the colour. This is user interaction.

  --- feedback ---

 User interaction is how the project reacts to the user doing things such as moving the mouse and clicking on the screen.
