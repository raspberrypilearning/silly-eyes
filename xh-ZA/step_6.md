## Upgrade your project

If you have time, you can upgrade your project.

### Add Stage effects

Make your project do something when you click on the **Stage**.

![The Stage with graphic effects.](images/stage-effects.png){:width="300px"}
{:width="300px"}

--- task ---

Click on the Stage pane and then on the **Code** tab to add code to the **Stage**.

**Choose:** Choose what you want to change when the **Stage** is clicked.

--- collapse ---

title: Change graphic effects when the Stage is clicked
---

```blocks3
when stage clicked
change [color v] effect by [25]
```

--- /collapse ---

--- collapse ---

title: Switch backdrop when the Stage is clicked
---

```blocks3
when stage clicked
next backdrop
```

--- /collapse ---

--- /task ---

### Add more

You could also add:
- More body parts
- More sprites with silly eyes
- More backdrops
- More accessories, or add more costumes to your accessories

This **Sporg** character also has arms that `point towards the mouse pointer`{:class="block3motion"}.
<div class="scratch-preview" style="margin-left: 15px;">
  <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

If you add other body parts, you will need to centre them at the point that you want them to rotate from. For example, an arm would rotate from the shoulder.
