## Make silly eyes

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Make the silly eyes! Each eye needs to be a separate sprite so that it can move separately.

If you need help, look at the tips in the **Debug** task at the bottom of this step.

Use the **Paint** option to create a new **sprite**. 

![The 'Paint' option in the 'Choose a Sprite' menu.](images/paint-a-sprite.png)

The Paint editor will open, which will allow you to create your **Eyeball** sprite's costume.

--- /task ---

It is really important that:
- The black pupil and coloured iris face to the right-hand side of the **Eyeball** costume
- The **Eyeball** costume is centred

--- task ---

**Choose:** Draw an eyeball **or** start from a round sprite.

Select the **Circle** tool.

To draw a perfect circle, press and hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key on the keyboard while you draw with the **Circle** tool. If you are using a tablet, try to get as close to a perfect circle as you can.

In this example, we set the **Outline** to black and the **Fill** colour of the eyeball to white:

![A white eyeball with a black outline.](images/eyeball-outline.png)

Use the **Fill** and **Outline** colour choosers to choose colours. To make black, slide both the **Saturation** and **Brightness** to `0`. To make white, slide the **Saturation** to `0` and the **Brightness** to `100`.

Make sure that the eyeball is centred — move it so that the blue cross in the costume lines up with the grey crosshair in the Paint editor.

Draw a smaller perfect circle and position it on the right-hand side of the eyeball:

![An eyeball with a red iris and black pupil on the right-hand side.](images/eyeball-with-iris.png)

You could also draw circles inside circles, or use colour, to get different effects.

There are costumes in Scratch that you can edit to make silly eyes for your character. 

Click on the **Choose a Costume** icon to see the library Scratch costumes. 

![The Choose a Costume icon.](images/choose-a-costume.png)

Click on the costume you want to add to your sprite. 

Use the Paint editor to change a costume. You could add circles, choose a different **Fill** colour, or remove parts of the costume to turn it into a silly eye. 

Make sure that the eyeball is centred — move it so that the blue cross in the costume lines up with the grey crosshair in the Paint editor.

**Tip:** The black pupil and coloured iris need to be positioned on the right-hand side of the costume so that the **Eyeball** follows the mouse pointer.

title: Reuse an eyeball costume from 🧩

The 🧩 sprite contains eyeballs that you can **reuse**.

Select the 🧩 sprite and click on Costumes then drag an eyeball costume to your Eyeball sprite in the Sprite pane.

Name your sprite `Eyeball` in the Sprite pane.

![The sprite's name set to 'Eyeball' in the Sprite pane.](images/eyeball-name.png)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Drag the **Eyeball** sprite to position it on the Stage, and change its size to fit your character.

--- /task ---

Now, make the eyeball look at the `mouse-pointer`{:class="block3motion"} so that the user can interact with your project.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**User**</span> means the person using the project (not just making it), and <span style="color: #0faeb0">**user interaction**</span> is how the project reacts to the user doing things such as moving the mouse and clicking on the screen. 
</p>

--- task ---

Add a script to `set the rotation style`{:class="block3motion"} to `all around`{:class="block3motion"} to make the eyeball `point towards the mouse pointer`{:class="block3motion"} `forever`{:class="block3control"}. 

--- collapse ---

title: Make a sprite point towards the mouse pointer

```blocks3
when flag clicked
set rotation style [all around v]
forever
point towards (mouse-pointer v)
end
```

--- /collapse ---

--- /task ---


If your character only has one eye, then you have finished. 

--- task ---

Otherwise, right-click (or on a tablet, tap and hold) on the **Eyeball** sprite in the Sprite list and choose **duplicate** to create more silly eyes.

[[[scratch3-duplicate-sprite]]]

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Click on the green flag and test your project. Do the silly eyes follow your mouse pointer as you move the mouse around?

**Tip:** You don't have to keep the mouse pointer on the Stage. The eyes will follow your mouse pointer as you carry on coding in Scratch.

--- task ---

**Debug:** You might find some bugs in your project that you need to fix. Here are some common bugs:

title: The eyes do not move

Make sure that you have added the code to the **Eyeball** sprites and **clicked on the green flag**. Your code will not run until you click on the green flag.

--- /collapse ---

--- 
title: The eyes point away from the mouse
---

In the **Eyeball** costumes, check that the pupil is on the right-hand side (past the blue cross in the middle of the costume). 

The **Eyeball** sprites have the `all around`{:class="block3motion"} `rotation style`{:class="block3motion"}, so they can rotate in any direction. 

When the **Eyeballs** rotate to `point towards`{:class="block3motion"} the `mouse-pointer`{:class="block3motion"}, the pupils will be closest to the mouse pointer.

Check that the **Eyeball** costumes are centred. To centre a costume, drag the costume so that the blue cross in the costume lines up with the grey crosshair in the Paint editor.

title: The character is in front of the eyes
---

When you drag a sprite to position it on the Stage, it moves in front of the other sprites. 

To get your **character** sprite to stay at the `back`{:class="block3looks"}, use:

```blocks3
when green flag clicked
forever
go to [back v] layer // behind all other sprites
```

--- /collapse ---

--- collapse ---

title: The character and the eyes follow the mouse pointer

Did you add the eyes as costumes for your **character** instead of as costumes for separate sprites? You can fix that. 

One way to fix it is to duplicate the **character** sprite and then rename the copy `Eyeball`. Then, delete the **Eyeball** costumes from the **character** sprite, and delete the **character** costumes from the **Eyeball** sprite. Then, you can duplicate the **Eyeball** sprite and name the copy `Eyeball 2`.

The code to `point towards`{:class="block3motion"} the `mouse-pointer`{:class="block3motion"} should be on the **Eyeball** sprites and not the **character** sprite.

--- /collapse ---

--- collapse ---
---
title: The character follows the mouse pointer (and the eyes do not)
---

You need to add the `point towards`{:class="block3motion"} code to the individual **Eyeball** sprites, not your **character** sprite!

To copy the code, you can drag the code from the Code area for your **character** to the **Eyeball** sprites in the Sprite list. 

You will also need to delete the script from the **character** sprite. To do this, drag the script to the Blocks menu.
