legend: Question 1 of 3

We added this code to an **Eyeball** sprite, but the eyeball is not rotating when the mouse pointer moves.

![Screenshot showing the script and the Stage. The script is not glowing yellow. The blocks in the script are: when flag clicked, set rotation style all around, forever, point toward mouse pointer.](images/code-not-running.png)

How could you fix the problem with just one action?

--- choices ---

- (x) Click on the green flag

  --- feedback --- Yes! Just adding the script does not make it run. You need to click on the green flag to make your code run.

Your code will have a yellow outline around it when it is running.

Forgetting to click on the green flag is a really common mistake — we all do it!

**Tip:** If you change code in a loop while it is running, Scratch will run the new code the next time that the loop runs! You don't need to click on the green flag again. This is really useful when you are trying out ideas.

- ( ) Click on the eyeball

  --- feedback --- The script does not start with a `when this sprite clicked`{:class="block3events"} block. --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Move the `set rotation style`{:class="block3looks"} block inside the `forever`{:class="block3control"} loop

  --- feedback --- You do not need to run the `set rotation style`{:class="block3looks"} block lots of times. If you set it once before the loop, it will not change until you set it to a different style. Moving the `set rotation style`{:class="block3looks"} block will not help with the problem in the question. --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Click on the Stage

  --- feedback --- You do not need to click on the Stage to get the eyeball to rotate. When the code is running, it will just follow the mouse pointer (or your finger, if you are using a tablet). --- /feedback ---
