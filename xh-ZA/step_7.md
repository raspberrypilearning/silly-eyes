## Share and play

If you are in a club, why not share your project with friends and peers?

You could also show your family how your project works.

If you have a Scratch account, you can share your project through Scratch. You can send a link to people you know, and the whole Scratch community will be able to find your project and try it out.

[[[share-scratch]]]

Why not invite your friends to create a project? Let them know how you had fun.

If you have a Scratch account, and have shared your 'Silly eyes' project, keep an eye out for comments that others may make about your creation. Feedback is a great way to reflect on your work. Ignore any comments that are unhelpful or irrelevant.
